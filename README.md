# System-Threat-Forecaster-ML

## Overview

This project aims to **predict the probability of a system getting infected by various families of malware** using telemetry data collected by antivirus software. It was developed as part of a Kaggle competition focused on machine learning applications in cybersecurity.

## ðŸ“‹ Competition Description

> The goal of this competition is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system.  
> The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by the system's antivirus software.

## ðŸ§  Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived meaningful indicators from complex telemetry fields to improve model generalization.
- **Modeling**: Built classification models to predict infection probabilities using popular machine learning frameworks.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like AUC-ROC, Log Loss, and accuracy were used to assess model performance.

## ðŸš€ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)
- Kaggle platform

## ðŸ“ˆ Use Cases
